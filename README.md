# SpotifyGeoFreedom

**Bypassing Regional Restrictions for a Free Spotify Account**

This solution is designed for users residing in countries where Spotify is not officially available and they are forced to register through other countries and also confirm their fake location every 14 days using a VPN.

## Method Overview

This method employs GitHub Actions to run a runner with a USA location three times a week. It logs into the desktop Spotify client using your username and password, allowing you to access Spotify as if you were in the USA.

### Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- A GitHub account
- A free Spotify account
- Your Spotify account must have the USA selected as the country ( if you have another country specified, then you can change it yourself to Usa, use Vpn )

### Does it really work?
I have no ideaðŸ¤£ as long as it's just being tested
